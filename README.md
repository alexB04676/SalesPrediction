## About the Data Cleaner

The data cleaner module used in this project was originally written during my Sentiment Analysis project.  
It was designed with reusability in mind, enabling me to adapt it to different datasets and contexts easily.  
You can view the original implementation [here]([text](https://github.com/alexB04676/SentimentAnalysis))

# Original Dataset

Since the dataset we work with is a cleaned version, i thought you might want to also take a look at the original.
In that case, you can find the original dataset [here]([text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data))
